This website was made to demonstrate my full stack web development skills as part of my first portfolio. My intention was to showcase a typical retail website with all the back end functionality that goes with it.

The server side was written using Node.JS and features packages such as express, passport and bcrypt. It uses EJS to handle views and mongoose to connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster as its datastore.

The client side was created with the help of Bootstrap. 

The site back end functionality includes:

    Creating Users
    User log in
    Add items to a cart
    Check out (up to but not including payment)
    User Profiles
    Admin login
    Site content management (edit offers and menu items)
